# A simple Tic Tac Toe AI

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game done in pygame where the player plays against an AI. 

**AI is implemented with a minimax algorithm.** This AI and the game are implemented in a very janky way and I might clean it up later.

## Future TODOs

- Add alpha-beta pruning to the AI
- Remove exessive code
- Clean up the code better
